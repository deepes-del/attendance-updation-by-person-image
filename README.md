# AI-Powered Attendance System Using Face Recognition

This project implements an AI-powered attendance management system using facial recognition technology. It automatically detects and identifies individuals from images or video feeds and updates the attendance records in real-time.

## Features
- **Facial Recognition**: Identifies individuals from images or video feeds using machine learning models.
- **Automated Attendance**: Updates attendance records in a database automatically.
- **High Accuracy**: Uses pre-trained deep learning models for robust face detection and recognition.
- **Scalable**: Can handle multiple users efficiently.

## Requirements
Make sure the following tools and libraries are installed:
- Python 3.7+
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- pandas
- dlib
- face_recognition
